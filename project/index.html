        <p>
          Take a step back in time on a century-old cable car and see the best views of downtown Pittsburgh while riding one of the few remaining inclines in the country. Opened on May 20, 1877, the
          Duquesne Incline was rescued and restored by a group of local residents in 1963 and still delights residents and visitors with its original, elegant, wooden cable cars. Now you can visit the
          interior of the incline and watch the machinery while it operates. The Duquesne Incline's upper station houses a museum of Pittsburgh history, including photos and a storehouse of
          information on inclines from around the world. Unusual Pittsburgh souvenirs, maps and photos can be found at the gift shop.

          <h2>Q: How can I pay my fare?</h2>
          <p>
            <b>You can pay the exact cash fare upon arrival. There are no tickets, no advance payment, no reservations and no debit or credit cards.</b> The Duquesne Incline is part of the
            transportation system in Pittsburgh and therefore uses the same _CASH_ fare system as the buses and trolleys. A change machine is available for your convenience. Having the exact fare in
            hand speeds up the payment process considerably. <b>Pennsylvania Seniors 65 and older who present a BLUE or YELLOW PRT card or a Senior ConnectCard ride free</b>, otherwise, the adult rate
            applies. The Duquesne Incline is required to request a Pennsylvania Senior Citizen Transit ID card as proof of discount eligiblity, no exceptions, in order to be reimbursed by the
            Commonwealth of PA.

        <h1>About the Incline</h1>
        <h2>Early History</h2>
        <p>
          The Duquesne Incline is one of those which follows very closely the tracks of an early coal hoist. Old newspapers indicate the existence of such a conveyance as early as 1854. Residents
          apparently referred to it as "Kirk Lewis' incline" and located it on the present site of The Duquesne Incline's Upper Station. Grandview Avenue was then the High Street, and the area was
          just beginning to be converted from farmland to homesites. This pleasantly-situated acreage was an excellent area to absorb some of the expanding population of the city, but the problem of
          easy access was still to be solved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although plans for a freight and passenger incline are known to have existed much earlier, financial backing was exceedingly hard to find--even the modest sum of $47,000--and actual
          construction was delayed. Eventually, of course, difficulties were overcome and the Incline was built. It was opened to the public May 20, 1877. The Duquesne Incline was the first Pittsburgh
          incline designed and built by Samuel Diescher, for Kirk Bigham and Associates. Mr. Diescher, an engineer, had become the country's foremost builder of inclines. He was also to design and
          build most of those that followed.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time of its public opening, it was one of four inclined planes serving the summit of Coal Hill, which later came to be known as Mount Washington. The Duquesne Incline was operated,
          from 1877 until 1962 by The Duquesne Inclined Plane Company. From 1964 until the present, the Incline has been operated by the Society for the Preservation of The Duquesne Heights Incline;
          it has been owned by the Port Authority of Allegheny County.
        </p>
        <h2>The Society for the Preservation of the Duquesne Heights Incline</h2>
        <p>
          The Society for the Preservation of the Duquesne Heights Incline was formed in 1964 by the Duquesne Heights/Mount Washington neighborhood group that had rescued, repaired, and reopened the
          Incline in 1963. The purpose was to continue to restore and rehabilitate the cars, equipment, and both stations, and to establish the entire operation as a reliable commuter facility and a
          popular visitor attraction. <b>Memberships in the society are available, please call for details.</b>
